=== Experiment Design ===

This document describes the division of the experiment script into individual screens
for the application.  The original script is in the file MMfMRI_Study1_script.doc.
The following screen codes are used to number the screens in
GestureMathProblemFlowActivity.java, as well as the audio files.

There are three gesture conditions: Gesture, Highlight, and Non-Gesture.



=== PRETRAINING ===

** Screen 0:

Text/Speech
Gesture -- I'm going to show you some hand movements to help you think about these problems and I want you to repeat them after me
Highlight/Non-Gesture -- I'm going to show you some words to help you think about these problems and I want you to repeat them after me

Next Screen 1

** Screen 1:

Text/Speech
All -- I want to make one side equal to the other side

Animation
Gesture -- show hand animation
Highlight -- show highlight animation
Non-Gesture -- no animation

Repeat Screen 1

Gesture -- Now I want you to repeat those words and hand movements
Highlight/Non-Gesture -- Now I want you to repeat those words

Input
